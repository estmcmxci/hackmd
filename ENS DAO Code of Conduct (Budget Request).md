## Overview

The purpose of the ENS' Code of Conduct is to create a culture that encourages high standards for inclusivity, representation and respect. This is a high impact document that serves as one of the DAO's foundations for a thriving and globally focused ecosystem.


> "The ENS DAO should consider adopting a code of conduct that spans the entire protocol - across users, moderators, delegates, contributors, stewards, and ideally TNL."
